# OSKHighlights
OSKHighlights is an open-source On Screen Keyboard that shows your keypresses via "highlighting" the keys that you press, useful for recording videos on your PC that requires or helps viewers further understand what is happening on your screen either via gaming or various PC hardware or software tutorials.

Aside from that, it is also a Key Spammer, useful for gaming. Fingers tired from tapping that skill key repeatedly while battling that boss? There's an option here where you can
just hold the key down and it'll send a keypress repeatedly for you. Don't wanna hold the key down either? There's an option for that as well; simply put what keys you want to be
toggleable keys in the Spam Keys Filter list in the Settings and then click the "Toggle Spam Keys" checkbox and when you press those keys, you don't need to hold it or tap it
repeatedly 'til your fingers are raw. You simply press the key once, and it'll spam it for you while you go and brew yourself a cup of coffee.
